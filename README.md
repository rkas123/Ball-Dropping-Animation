This Ball Dropping Animation is made using Vanilla JS only without any frameworks or packages.

The coefficient of Restitution is hard coded to 0.8. There is no resistance along the x direction, therefore, the ball's velocity's x component remains the same forever.

All the balls are spawned at random coordinates in the upper half of the screen and are given random x component of velocity.
